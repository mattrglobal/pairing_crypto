# APIs

The following document defines the conventions and concrete API structure for this library

## Conventions

The APIs use the following namespacing to indicate the operations a caller would like to perform:

curve::\[scheme\]::operation(inputs) -> output

Curves are the elliptic curve to be used to execute underlying cryptographic operations such as: bn256, bls12831, tweedle.

Scheme if included is the crypto primitive to use such as: bls, bbs, cdlnt, accumulator, bulletproof.

Ciphersuite if included specifies the suite to use for that system and operation like hashes, salts, and tags.

Operation is the function to be executed such as: key_gen, sign, verify, blind_sign, gen_proof, verify_proof, update.

## Curve Operations

1. {curve}.keygen(ikm, is_vt) -> kp = {pk, sk} says use the BLS12-381 curve for the BBS signature to create a new secret key using the provided input key material and corresponding public key in G1 or the variant G2.

## Schemes

1. BBS

### BBS Operations

1. {curve}.bbs.sign(kp, messages, generators) -> &sigma;
2. {curve}.bbs.verify(pk, messages, &sigma;) -> true or false
3. {curve}.bbs.proof_gen(pk, &sigma; messages, generators, reveal_indices) -> proof
4. {curve}.bbs.proof_verify(pk, proof, reveal_messages, generators, reveal_indices) -> true or false
