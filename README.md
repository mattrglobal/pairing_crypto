# Pairing Cryptography

This library is a simple and easy to use one stop shop for [pairing-based cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing-based_cryptography) written in [Rust](rust-lang.org).

**Note** This library has not undergone an independent implementation audit.

## Supported Curves

- [BLS 12-381](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-09#section-4.2.1)

For a more exhaustive list of those published by the [CFRG](https://irtf.org/cfrg) please refer to [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-09)

## Supported Signature Algorithms

- [BBS Signatures draft-03](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-03.html)

## API Design
